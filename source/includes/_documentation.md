# Maintaining the Documentation

This documentation is created using [Slate] (https://github.com/lord/slate). To build you will need to install some Ruby dependencies described [here] (https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Installing-Slate). Once you have the dependencies, then you will want to checkout the slate branch to modify the documentation. You can update the slate branch from it's origin using these [instructions] (https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Updating-Slate)
